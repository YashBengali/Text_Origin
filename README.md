-Built a program that given 2 sources of text and a third unknown text will identify which of the two original texts it is more similar to.

-Ran basic linguistic tests to generate dictionaries which were used in the comparisons

-Generated a first degree markov model of all the text models and ran the same linguistic tests on those for futher comparison.
